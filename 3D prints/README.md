# 3D Prints

I have divided the parts used in the building process of the CNC into 3 folders:

* Servo

  The servos control the Y axis, I used 9g servos because they were what I had lying around. They use a rack and pinion system to move.

  

* Slider

  The slider is made to move over a 27mmx15mm spar of wood, together with the stepper they also use a rack and pinion to move through the X axis.

* Stepper

  The stepper is coupled with the slider with a rubber band ensuring that there is good contact between the rack and the gear at all times. The steppers used are 24byj28, I took them out from a broken 3D printer.
